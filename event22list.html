            <h3>A Night Of Star Gazing @ Astro Payyanur</h3>
            Date:14/08/2022
            Place:Payyanur
            No. of Participants: 27
         <p>   
            Calypso GCEK held a night of star gazing at Astro Payyanur during Space Week, attended by 22 students and execs. 
            The program began with an interesting lecture by the founder of Astro Payyanur. After dinner at 7:30 P.M.,
             we visited the mini planetarium and learned about various constellations. We returned to the seminar hall for the next session, 
             but our star gazing was unfortunately interrupted due to cloudy skies. The next session on astrology was held 
              at 4:30 A.M. with Mr. Gangadharan, who emphasized the importance of not blindly following astrological beliefs. </p>
